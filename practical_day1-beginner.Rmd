## Project - set-up

- Create a new project in a meaningful folder name on your computer such as
`R_workshop/day1-beginner`

using the project manager utility, top-right of the rstudio window.

![project menu](img/rstudio_project.png)

- Create a new folder `data` using bottom-right panel > **Files** tab > _New Folder_ button 

![Files tab](img/rstudio_newfolder.png)

- Create a new script to write and execute your `R` commands.
top-left panel > **Create** icon > _New Script_ entry.

![create menu](img/rstudio_newscript.png)

Now, you have the 4 panels of the rstudio layout.

- Save the script with a relevant name `practical-beginner.R`

## Reading data

Download this simple tab-separated file
http://lsru.github.io/r_workshop/data/women.tsv

and save it inside the folder `R_workshop/day1-beginner/data`.

Remember, your current active rstudio project should be `day1-beginner`

load it: All paths are relative to the root which is the projects folder
```{r, eval=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
library("readr")
df <- read_tsv("data/women.tsv", col_names = TRUE)
df
```

Thanks to `readr` the object `df` is already a _tibble diff_ [rstudio blog: tibble](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/24/tibble-1-0-0/)


## Manipulate a data frame

We keep this section short, as we will focus on `dplyr` to perform tasks on `data frames`

Access to one column, display only the first elements
```{r}
head(df$height)
```

Using a similar syntax, apply:

- the function `mean()` to find the mean of women' height.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
mean(women$height)
```
- the function `var()` to find the variance of women' weight.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
var(women$weight)
```

To compute her BMI (remember `height` are inches and `weight` US pounds) the formula is:

$$BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2} * 703$$

For the first individual (`^2` for square):
```{r}
(115 / 58^2) * 703
```

- Compute the BMI for all individuals, save it as `bmi`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
bmi <- (women$weight / women$height^2) * 703
```

- Compute the mean and median of all BMI
```{r, solution=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
mean(bmi)
median(bmi)
```

## plotting

First load `dplyr`. This enables the use of the `%>%` pipe operator
```{r}
library("dplyr")
```

Using `df` dataset:

- plot the `heigh` in function of the weight (`geom_point()`)

```{r, solution=TRUE}
library("ggplot2")
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = height))+
  geom_point()
```

- use the previous scatterplot, but map the point' size to the `bmi`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = height,
             size = bmi))+
  geom_point()
```

## tidying and plotting

`df` has 2 columns, both contain values.
- use `gather()` from `tidyr` to get two columns
  + `measure` for either height or weight
  + `value` for actual measurements
Remember that `gather` takes by default all columns.
- store the result into `df_melt`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
library("tidyr")
df_melt <- gather(df, measure, value)
```

- plot the distribution as boxplots of both measures
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = measure, y = value))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

## plot densities

### adding a column to a data frame

Let's add `bmi` as a third column to `df`.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
df$bmi <- bmi
head(df)
```

### plot densities

- tidy the 3 columns and plot all densities using different colours and set them translucent
You will need to make a new `df_melt` data frame first.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt <- gather(df, measure, value)
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = measure, colour = measure))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

The 3 distributions have very different ranges.

- Plot the same data but faceting it by `measure` (Use the appropriate **free** `scale`).
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = measure, colour = measure))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)+
  facet_wrap(~ measure, scale = "free")
```

When faceting, the 3 distributions are drawn in distinct plots: mapping the colours to `measure` is useless.

- redo the plot using a `lightblue` colour for all. Be careful to **NOT** set the colour inside `aes()`.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value))+
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7)+
  facet_wrap(~ measure, scale = "free")
```

## Supplementary exercices

### reading more complex file

Microarray data from the GEO dataset GSE35982.

- download this compressed file: [GSE35982.tsv.gz](http://lsru.github.io/r_workshop/data/GSE35982.tsv.gz) in
your `data` folder.
- read it using `read_tsv()` and store it into a data frame named `gse`. The file will be uncompressed seamlessly.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
gse <- read_tsv("data/GSE35982.tsv.gz")
```

- Is the file tidy?
```{asis, solution = TRUE}
No, since all samples (starts by "GSM*") are in different columns
```

- Tidy the samples. Look at the `gather` help page to select columns based on characters.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
library("tidyr")
gse_melt <- gse %>%
  gather(sample, value, starts_with("GSM"))
```

- plot the distributions as boxplots
```{r, solution=TRUE}
library("ggplot2")
gse_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = value))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```

- Any obvious issues? Check the file and find out what happened.
```{asis, box = "blue", boxtitle = "Hint"}
the `locale` setting in `readr` allows to specify the decimal mark used for float numbers
```
- Correct the mistake by reading again the file with the adjusted relevant option and store the data into a a new object.
- Replace the wrong column in `gse` by the correct one found in the data frame you just created.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
gsefr <- read_tsv("data/GSE35982.tsv.gz", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))
gse$GSM878683 <- gsefr$GSM878683
```


- tidy the samples again.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
gse_melt <- gse %>%
  gather(sample, value, starts_with("GSM"))
```
- plot the distributions as boxplots
```{r, solution=TRUE}
gse_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = value))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```

- do the data appear normalised?
```{asis, solution = TRUE}
Yes, perfectly normalised
```
