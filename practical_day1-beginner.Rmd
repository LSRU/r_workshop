## Project - set-up

- Create a new project in a meaningful folder name on your computer such as
`R_workshop/day1-beginner`

using the project manager utility, top-right of the rstudio window.

![project menu](img/rstudio_project.png)

- Create a new folder `data` using bottom-right panel > **Files** tab > _New Folder_ button 

![Files tab](img/rstudio_newfolder.png)

- Create a new script to write and execute your `R` commands.
top-left panel > **Create** icon > _New Script_ entry.

![create menu](img/rstudio_newscript.png)

Now, you have the 4 panels of the rstudio layout.

- Save the script with a relevant name `practical-beginner.R`

## Reading data

Download this simple tab-separated file
http://lsru.github.io/r_workshop/data/women.tsv

and save it inside the folder `R_workshop/day1-beginner/data`.

Remember your current active rstudio project should be `day1-beginner`

load it, now the root is the project, so all paths are relative to it
```{r, eval=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
library("readr")
df <- read_tsv("data/women.tsv", col_names = TRUE)
df
```

Thanks to `readr` the object `df` is already a _tibble diff_ [rstudio blog: tibble](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/24/tibble-1-0-0/)


## Manipulate data frame

We keep this section short, as we will see `dplyr` to perform tasks on `data frames`

Access to one column, display only the first elements
```{r}
head(df$height)
```

Using a similar syntax, apply:

- the function `mean()` to find the mean of women' height.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
mean(women$height)
```
- the function `var()` to find the variance of women' weight.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
mean(women$weight)
```

To compute her BMI (remember `height` are inches and `weight` US pounds) the formula is:

$$BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2} * 703$$

For the first individual (`^2` for square):
```{r}
(115 / 58^2) * 703
```

- Compute the BMI for all individuals, save it as `bmi`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
bmi <- (women$weight / women$height^2) * 703
```

- Compute the mean and median of all BMI
```{r, solution=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
mean(bmi)
median(bmi)
```

## plotting

First load `dplyr` so we can the `%>%` pipe operator
```{r}
library("dplyr")
```

Using `df` dataset:

- plot the `heigh` in function of the weight (`geom_point()`)

```{r, solution=TRUE}
library("ggplot2")
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = height))+
  geom_point()
```

- use the previous scatterplot, but map the point' size to the `bmi`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = height,
             size = bmi))+
  geom_point()
```

## tidying and plotting

`df` has 2 columns, both contain values.
- use `gather()` from `tidyr` to get two columns
  + `measure` for either height or weight
  + `value` for actual measurements
Remember that `gather` takes by default all columns.
- save as `df_melt`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
library("tidyr")
df_melt <- gather(df, measure, value)
```

- plot the distribution as boxplots of both measures
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = measure, y = value))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

## plot densities

### adding a column to a data frame

Let's add `bmi` as a third column to `df`.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
df$bmi <- bmi
head(df)
```

### plot densities

- tidy the 3 columns and plot all densities using different colours and transparency
You will need to make a new `df_melt` data frame first.
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt <- gather(df, measure, value)
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = measure, colour = measure))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

The 3 distributions have very different ranges.

- redo the plot using a faceting by `measure` with the appropriate **free** `scale`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = measure, colour = measure))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)+
  facet_wrap(~ measure, scale = "free")
```

The 3 distributions now have their own plots, mapping the colours to `measure` is useless.

- redo the plot using a `lightblue` colour for all. Be careful to NOT set the colour inside `aes()`
```{r, solution=TRUE}
df_melt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value))+
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7)+
  facet_wrap(~ measure, scale = "free")
```
