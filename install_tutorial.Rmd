## Install R

`R` is available for free for Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS.  
As for now, the latest version is `3.2.5`.

One common complain about `R` is the frequency of updates. True, but that could be sorted out
by a good **package manager**

### Windows

Visit the [download page](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and choose the corresponding installer for your platform.

One way to circumvent the absence of package manager for Windows, is to install the `R` package
`installr`. This package provide a function `updateR()` to takes care of updating your R installtion
and the migration of your installed packages whenever a major `R` release happens.

### MacOS

You could either use the [download page](https://cloud.r-project.org/) or better use the 
[Homebrew package manager](http://brew.sh/).

Once `homebrew` installed, you can install/uninstall easily with dependencies many programs
and utilities. This implies to use the terminal, but worth it if you ask me.
Then, installation is done with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
brew install r
```

and the updates will be automatically done for all your software by
```{r, eval=FALSE}
brew update; brew upgrade
```

### GNU/Linux

Any Linux distributions is bundled with a great package manager such as `dpkg` or `rpm`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt-get install r-base
```


## Install Rstudio

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Editor, it wraps and interface `R` but, 
`R` needs to installed first. The free-version contains everything you need.

Visit the [download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and
choose the corresponding installer for your platform. As for now, the latest version is `0.99.893`.
